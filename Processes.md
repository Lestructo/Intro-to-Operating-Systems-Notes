Stack >> Function

Processes and Memory
- Text: Storage of code
- Date: Global variables (pre-allocated space)
- Heap: Dynamically allocated space
- Stack: Local variable storage

Stack and Heap
- Stack grows downward with each nested function call
    - Local variables, register state, return memory address
- Heap
    - Storage of dynamically allocated items that must be persistent across function calls (and returns from function calls)
    - OOP Languages: Object instantiation is done in the heap
 
**Process State**
A process is in exactly on state at any instance in time.
